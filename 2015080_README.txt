This is my implementation of the link-state and the distance-vector algorithms

I have implemented Dijkstra's Algorithm and Bellman-Ford Algorithm

Usage :-

Simply run the individual codes

Example -

javac BellmanFord_2015080.java
java BellmanFord_2015080

Three options are there n,q,c namely :-

n = new graph with new nodes, edges and weights
q = quit
c = change graph with same nodes but different weights b/w them
